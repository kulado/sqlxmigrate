sqlxmigrate is a minimalistic database schema migration helper for sqlx. 

This project was inspired by github.com/GuiaBolso/darwin as it provides simple approach for handling 
database schema. This package however only supports direct SQL statements for each migration and thus 
unable to handle complex migrations and does not support persisting which migrations have been executed.

The project `gormigrate` github.com/go-gormigrate/gormigrate provides schema migration for the Gorm ORM. 
While GORM has is place, there was an opportunity to replace GORM with the sqlx database package to provide 
a more flexible schema migration tool. This project was original forked from gormigrate and then Gorm was 
replaced with sqlx. 

## Supported databases

It supports any of the [databases sqlx supports]:

- PostgreSQL

### Additional database support:
Need to determine a plan to abstract the schema logic currently defined in sqlxmigrate_test.go 
on a driver basis. The sql statement for creating a table in postgres, differs from MySql, etc. 

## Installing

```bash
go get -u github.com/kulado/sqlxmigrate
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"database/sql"
	"log"

	"github.com/kulado/sqlxmigrate"
	"github.com/jmoiron/sqlx"
	_ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

func main() {
	// this Pings the database trying to connect, panics on error
	// use sqlx.Open() for sql.Open() semantics
	db, err := sqlx.Connect("postgres", "host=127.0.0.1 user=postgres dbname=sqlxmigrate_test port=5433 sslmode=disable password=postgres")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("main : Register DB : %v", err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	m := sqlxmigrate.New(db, sqlxmigrate.DefaultOptions, []*sqlxmigrate.Migration{
		// create persons table
		{
			ID: "201608301400",
			Migrate: func(tx *sql.Tx) error {
				q := `CREATE TABLE "people" (
						"id" serial,
						"created_at" timestamp with time zone,
						"updated_at" timestamp with time zone,
						"deleted_at" timestamp with time zone,
						"name" text , 
						PRIMARY KEY ("id")
					)`
				_, err = tx.Exec(q)
				return err
			},
			Rollback: func(tx *sql.Tx) error {
				q := `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS people`
				_, err = tx.Exec(q)
				return err
			},
		},
		// add age column to persons
		{
			ID: "201608301415",
			Migrate: func(tx *sql.Tx) error {
				q := `ALTER TABLE people 
						ADD column age int 
					`
				_, err = tx.Exec(q)
				return err
			},
			Rollback: func(tx *sql.Tx) error {
				q := `ALTER TABLE people 
						DROP column age`
				_, err = tx.Exec(q)
				return err
			},
		},
	})

	if err = m.Migrate(); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Could not migrate: %v", err)
	}
	log.Printf("Migration did run successfully")
}
```

## Having a separated function for initializing the schema

If you have a lot of migrations, it can be a pain to run all them, as example,
when you are deploying a new instance of the app, in a clean database.
To prevent this, you can set a function that will run if no migration was run
before (in a new clean database). Remember to create everything here, all tables,
foreign keys and what more you need in your app.

```go

m := sqlxmigrate.New(db, sqlxmigrate.DefaultOptions, []*sqlxmigrate.Migration{
    // you migrations here
})

m.InitSchema(func(*sqlx.DB) error {
    // seed initial tables
    return nil
})
```

## Options

This is the options struct, in case you don't want the defaults:

```go
type Options struct {
	// Migrations table name. Default to "migrations".
	TableName string
	// The name of the column that stores the ID of migrations. Defaults to "id".
	IDColumnName string
}
```

## Contributing

To run tests, first copy `.sample.env` as `sample.env` and edit the connection
string of the database you want to run tests against. Then, run tests like
below:

```bash
# running tests for PostgreSQL
export PG_CONN_STRING="host=127.0.0.1 user=postgres dbname=sqlxmigrate_test port=5433 sslmode=disable password=postgres"
go test -tags postgresql

# running test for MySQL
go test -tags mysql

# running test for multiple databases at once
go test -tags 'postgresql mysql'
```

Or alternatively, you could use Docker to easily run tests on all databases
at once. To do that, make sure Docker is installed and running in your machine
and then run:

```bash
task docker
```

Or Manually execute docker

```bash
# Build the test container
docker build -t sqlxmigrate .

# Ensure previous containers have stopped
docker-compose down -v

# Run the tests:
docker-compose run sqlxmigrate go test -v -tags 'postgresql'
```
